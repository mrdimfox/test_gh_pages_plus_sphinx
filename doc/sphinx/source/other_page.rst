.. toctree::
   :hidden:

   other_page_subpage

This is another page of docs with its own
separated file! Wow!

Let's make some test of `jsdoc`.
Here you can see completely empty function:

.. js:autofunction:: emptyFunction

As you can see, this functions is **completely** useless.

<-- Also it has subpages! Amassing!
